    <h1>Privacy Policy for One Sudoku</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the One Sudoku app. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app. Please take a moment to read this document carefully.</p>
    <p>One Sudoku is a mobile game that offers a traditional Sudoku puzzle experience. The app is designed to work offline and does not collect any personal or sensitive data from its users. By using the One Sudoku app, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms outlined here, please do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>One Sudoku is an offline game, meaning that it does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from users. We do not require any account creation, and the game does not ask for any user-specific data such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or payment information.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we do not gather any data related to your usage of the app, such as your game progress or preferences. All data related to your game play remains strictly local on your device and is not shared with any servers, third-party services, or external entities.</p>

    <h2>Permissions We Do Not Use</h2>
    <p>Our app does not require any permissions that could access sensitive data or features of your device. Specifically, One Sudoku does not request access to the following features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Camera</li>
      <li>Microphone</li>
      <li>Contacts</li>
      <li>Location</li>
      <li>Storage (beyond app-specific data needed for local use)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not require any network access as One Sudoku is designed to work entirely offline. No internet connection is necessary to play the game or to use any of its features.</p>

    <h2>Offline Functionality</h2>
    <p>One Sudoku is an offline game. All game data and progress are stored locally on your device, and no data is transmitted to any external servers. As such, the game does not rely on any network connections to function, ensuring that your gameplay and personal information remain private and secure.</p>
    <p>Since the app does not require an internet connection, we do not engage in any data collection or tracking. This includes tracking user behavior, preferences, or any other personal details. We do not use any form of analytics, third-party tracking tools, or advertising networks in our app.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>One Sudoku does not use cookies, web beacons, or any other tracking technologies. We do not collect, store, or track any information about your device or your behavior within the app. Our app is entirely offline, and all interactions are confined to the device itself.</p>
    <p>Since we do not use cookies or other tracking technologies, there is no risk of your personal data being shared with advertisers, analytics companies, or other third-party entities. We believe in providing a completely private and uninterrupted gaming experience for our users.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>One Sudoku does not integrate with or rely on any third-party services for its core functionality. We do not use any third-party advertising networks, analytics services, or social media sharing tools. The app operates independently and does not share any data with external services.</p>
    <p>We may provide links to external websites or third-party services for additional information, but these links are provided solely for convenience. We do not control the content or privacy practices of any third-party sites, and users should review the privacy policies of those websites before engaging with them.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>One Sudoku is designed to be a family-friendly app suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect any personal data from children under the age of 13. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected data from a child, please contact us immediately, and we will take appropriate steps to delete that information.</p>
    <p>Since the app does not require any personal data, it is safe for children to use without concern for privacy violations. However, parents are encouraged to review the appâ€™s features to ensure that it meets their privacy preferences for their children.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect the security of any data stored locally on your device, although it is important to note that since the app does not transmit or store any user data externally, the security risks are minimal. The data generated by the app (such as game progress) remains on your device and cannot be accessed by anyone else without physical access to the device.</p>
    <p>However, we cannot guarantee complete security as no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we encourage you to take necessary steps to secure your device, such as using device encryption, setting strong passwords, and enabling other security features available on your device.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any changes, we will post the updated policy on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our privacy practices.</p>
    <p>Any changes to this policy will be effective as soon as they are posted on this page, unless otherwise stated. By continuing to use the One Sudoku app after any changes are made, you agree to be bound by the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
